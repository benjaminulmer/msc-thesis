\altchapter{\bf{Abstract}}
Recent technological advancements have led to unprecedented amounts of 3D data becoming available about the Earth.
Hierarchical partitionings of the surface of the Earth, known as Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), have proven to be useful tools for integrating data on the Earth's surface; however, they have no native support for 3D data. Instead, a 3D version of this data structure is needed. In this thesis, we explore a particular class of refinement methods, which we term semiregular degenerate, as a potential solution to reduced cell size and compactness near the central singularity seen in typical approaches for a 3D DGGS.
We propose both a modification of an existing 3D DGGS to improve its volume preservation properties and a general framework for extending any existing DGGS to the third dimension. We also derive a set of mapping functions that facilitate efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for both these methods.
