\subsection{SDOG Indexing} \label{sec:sdog-indexing}
In order to identify and distinguish the cells of a grid, there needs to be a method to assign a unique index to each cell.
A good indexing scheme will allow for efficient data insertion, retrieval, and manipulation via a set of queries.
Examples of some of these queries are: point to cell, which give the index of the cell containing a given point; index inversion, which calculates a cell's location and geometry from the index; neighbourhood queries; and in the case of a hierarchical grid, hierarchy traversal to find parent and children cells.


Due to the fact that SDOG refinement is based on the midpoints of spherical coordinates, an indexing scheme that is efficient for many of the above operations can be easily developed.
At any refinement level, $k$, each cell can be given an integer index in each spherical coordinate ranging from zero to $2^{k} - 1$.
To address the degenerate refinement of certain cells, these integer indices are modified appropriately with divisions by powers of two, which can be done quickly with bit shift operations.
The integer indices can then be linearized by various methods, one good choice being a Z-order curve \cite{morton1966computer} as used in \cite{yu2009sdog}.
A more detailed description of degenerate Z-order indexing for SDOG grids, including algorithms for point to cell and index inversion operations, can be found in \cite{yu2009coding}.

%\section{Mapping Modified SDOG Grids} \label{sec:mapping}
By modifying the splitting surfaces used for subdivision, any SDOG indexing operations that depend on the location of cells in the grid will no longer function properly.
Examples of these operations include point to cell queries, which give the cell that contains a given point, and index inversion, which calculates the location and geometry of a cell from its index.
The obvious solution is to simply redefine these operations on the new geometry, however, this is not necessarily practical as it would have to be done individually for each modified grid.
Additionally, the more complex geometry of the modified grids may make these algorithms more difficult to design and/or more computationally expensive to perform as compared to the ones for conventional SDOG.
A better solution is to find a mapping (and corresponding inverse mapping) between a conventional SDOG grid and the grid resulting from the modified subdivision scheme.
Given this mapping, all indexing operations can be done using the standard algorithms, with inputs and outputs converted between the conventional SDOG grid and the modified one accordingly.


For the stationary subdivision schemes this mapping is straightforward.
Since only the latitudinal splitting surface of SG cells is modified, latitudes in the range $[0, \pm\frac{\pi}{4})$ should be mapped to the range $[0, \pm\alpha_{\phi}^{SG} \frac{\pi}{2})$ and likewise the range $[\pm\frac{\pi}{4}, \pm\frac{\pi}{2}]$ to the range $[\pm\alpha_{\phi}^{SG} \frac{\pi}{2}, \pm\frac{\pi}{2}]$.
This can be done with a simple linear map, and the inverse follows trivially.


For the non-stationary schemes this mapping is more complicated.
We wish to define a function $M \colon (\phi, r) \rightarrow (\phi, r)$ that converts a latitude and radius in a conventional SDOG grid to the corresponding latitude and radius in the modified grid (longitude does not need to be mapped, as it is not changed between the two grids).
The two coordinates act independently of each other, so we can split this function into its two components, $M_{\phi}(\phi)$ and $M_{r}(r)$, and derive each one and its inverse individually.
This is done by parameterizing points inside an NG cell using the function(s) used to calculate its splitting surfaces (Eq.~(\ref{eq:convex}) for conventional SDOG and Eq.~(\ref{eq:radVol}) and (\ref{eq:latVol}) for the modified grid).
NG cells are used for this purpose as all children cells are also NG, and therefore use the same formulations for calculating splitting surfaces.
By finding the boundaries of the coarsest NG cell that contains a given point, these parameterizations can be used to go from one space to the other by finding a relationship between them---in this case $d = \alpha = p$---all of which can be done in constant time.
The final formulations are as follows, with the full derivation found in Appendix \ref{app:map}.
Let $R_m$ be the radius of the grid.
Latitude forward:
%
\begin{equation*}
M_{\phi}(\phi) = \sin^{-1} \left( d u_{v} + \left( 1 - d \right) \ell_{v} \right), \quad \text{where}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
d = \frac{\frac{2\phi}{\pi} - \ell_{c}}{u_{c} - \ell_{c}},
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
u_{c} = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lceil \log_{0.5} \left( 1 - \frac{2\phi}{\pi} \right) \right\rceil }, \quad u_{v} = 2 u_{c} - u_{c}^{2}.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\ell_{c} = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lfloor \log_{0.5} \left( 1 - \frac{2\phi}{\pi} \right) \right\rfloor }, \quad \text{and} \quad \ell_{v} = 2 \ell_{c} - \ell_{c}^{2}.
\end{equation*}
%
%
Radius forward:
%
\begin{equation*}
M_{r}(r) = R_{m} \sqrt[3]{ d u^{3} + \left( 1 - d \right) \ell^{3} }, \quad \text{where}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
d = \frac{\frac{r}{R_{m}} - \ell}{u - \ell},
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
u = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lfloor \log_{0.5} \left( \frac{r}{R_{m}} \right) \right\rfloor }, \quad \text{and} \quad
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\ell = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lceil \log_{0.5} \left( \frac{r}{R_{m}} \right) \right\rceil }.
\end{equation*}
%
%
Latitude inverse:
%
\begin{equation*}
M^{-1}_{\phi}(\phi) = \frac{\pi}{2} \left( d u_{c} + \left( 1 - d \right) \ell_{c} \right), \quad \text{where}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
d = \frac{\sin \phi - \ell_{v}}{u_{v} - \ell_{v}},
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
u_{c} = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lceil \log_{0.5} \left( \sqrt{1 - \sin \phi} \right) \right\rceil },
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\ell_{c} = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{ \left\lfloor \log_{0.5} \left( \sqrt{1 - \sin \phi} \right) \right\rfloor },
\end{equation*}
%
%
and both $u_{v}$ and $\ell_{v}$ follow the same as the forward.
Radius inverse:
%
\begin{equation*}
M^{-1}_{r}(r) = R_m \left( d u + \left( 1 - d \right) \ell \right), \quad \text{where}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
d = \frac{ \left( \frac{r}{R_{m}} \right)^{3} - \ell^{3}}{u^{3} - \ell^{3}}
\end{equation*}
%
and both $u$ and $\ell$ follow the same as the forward.


In the case where a division by zero occurs, (i.e. when $u = \ell$ or $u_{c} = \ell_{c}$), the result of said division is treated as zero.
The latitude mappings assume $\phi \ge 0$, however, from symmetry a negative value of $\phi$ can easily be accommodated by using the absolute value and negating the final result.
This mapping is applicable to the first non-stationary scheme discussed in Section \ref{sec:method-nonStationary}; schemes derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:beta}) cannot be mapped, as this formulation cannot easily be expressed in terms of a parameter.
In the future, other blending methods may be explored that allow for a similar mapping to be derived.
