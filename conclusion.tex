\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}
This thesis explores how semiregular degenerate refinement can be used to make 3D DGGS's.
First show how modifying splitting surfaces can improve volume preservation by looking at SDOG.
Then derive general method for extending a 2D DGGS to the third dimension.
To define coding algorithms, we first derive radial mappings that allow volume preservation for grid extensions and map between conventional SDOG and modifications.
Similarly, provided latitude mappings for SDOG that do the same thing.
Use these mapping to define the coding operations that operate in more uniform grid space while still having volume preservation in physical space.
For SDOG, also give direct coding algorithms that have not been previously explored in literature.
Also give neighbour, child, and parent operations for SDOG and in general for grid extension.
The grid extension is fully implemented and used to demonstrate three potential use cases of 3D DGGS using three different grid systems.
Given input DGGS, creating 3D DGGS is instant and only requires three parameters clearly defined and explored in the thesis.


\section{Limitations and Future Work}
Field of 3D DGGS relatively young and unexplored.
Despite generalness of method, only creates on general type of 3D DGGS.
Also has limitations.
No general way to linearize layer index and surface index (or even layer index itself).
This important for DGGS, and further research would not only solve this, but could also be extended to time for 4D DGGS.
Only discussed sphere based DGGS in this thesis.
Earth more accurately approximated with oblate spheroid.
Believe our method works for ellipsoid based DGGS, but more careful exploration, generalization, and justification is needed.


Need better encoding for more complex geometry.
Encoding polylines, polygons, 3D models and meshes very important operations.
Version used in use cases were naive and simple as proof of concept.
These type of algorithms typically quite specific to grid type.
Generalization/classification for creating efficient versions for arbitrary grid would further support quick iteration on creating and testing different DGGS, both 2D and 3D.


Occlusion big issue with volumetric DE.
3D DGGS may be able to aid in this.
Slice views and select layers could aid in occlusion.
