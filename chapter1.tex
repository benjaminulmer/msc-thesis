\chapter{Introduction}

Hook paragraph. Main points:
Earth is important (home to all of humanity/all life).
Earth is vast.
Earth is diverse.
Minor/optional points:
Earth is fragile.
Earth is cosmically insignificant.

%Yet despite the cosmic insignificance of the Earth, all of humanity---and in fact all life we are aware of---call this planet home. From the [] of the [] to the [] of the [], the Earth is both vast and diverse. Given that Earth is the [], humanity has collected large amounts of data the planet.  Likewise, the data available about the Earth is similarly vast and diverse. 

Given its significance to all of humanity, it is vital to understand and protect the Earth.
One of the ways we 



Large amounts of data being collected. Geospatial big data: data sets exceeding capacity of current computing systems~\cite{lee2015geospatial} Geospatial data has applications in urban planning, agriculture, education, natural disaster prediction and management, and countless other fields. Need tools to efficiently integrate, process, visualize, and analyze data in order to make informed decisions. \textbf{Digital Earth here}


Geographic information systems (GIS) are the conventional approach used for these tasks in a computational environment.
With a GIS, different datasets are represented as individual map layers in a planar coordinate system, which acts as a proxy for the Earth.
However, geospatial data exists in many different formats and resolutions and is created and gathered by disparate organizations.
The conventional GIS pipeline---which requires experts to clean, process, integrate, and distribute data---is not sustainable in the face of geospatial big data.
Furthermore, even after data has been integrated with a GIS, overlay operations such as intersections and data extraction are computationally expensive when many data layers are present.
Coordinate based representations of geospatial data also do not provide good facilities to represent the uncertainty or error of the data they are used to represent.

%Traditional approach is GIS which allows datasets to be represented as map layers in coordinate system which acts as proxy for the earth. However different datasets need to be integrated, which exist in different formats and resolutions created by disparate organization. The conventional GIS pipeline which requires experts to clean, process, integrate, and distribute data is not sustainable in the face of geospatial big data. Furthermore, even once data has been integrated into common format/coordinate system, overlay operations are still computationally expensive. Can also imply precision that does not exist---points represented exactly when in reality there is uncertainty. 

Beyond these fundamental challenges of GIS, the use of planar coordinates as the underlying representation comes with its own problems. %TODO better word for challenges here (or above usage)?
Flattening the Earth produces inevitable map edges and distortion that impact the analysis and visualization of geospatial data.
Map edges can cause serious misunderstanding of the continuity between different sides of the map---especially with young children~\cite{hennerdal2015beyond}---and also affect the estimation of distance even when the continuity is correctly understood~\cite{hruby20182000}.
Distortion causes inaccuracies in calculations such as geodesics and buffering if planar geometry is used~\cite{flaterbuffering}, which is especially problematic when working with large distances and areas.
These distortions can also affect the visual analysis of data by misrepresenting the area of regions and distances between points. 

Model globes avoid many of the shortcomings of planar maps by providing a more accurate reference model for the Earth.
Despite this, the ability for physical maps to be easily made and stored, display the entire Earth at once, and accommodate any scale has made them the preferred option in many situations. 
With the advent of a Digital Earth, however, many the drawbacks of physical globes are lessened or negated.
Computer graphics algorithms and hardware allow globes to be rendered in real-time, storage is no different than for a digital flat map, and interactive systems allow zooming and panning to show any part of the Earth at any scale.
The only challenge not fully solved is displaying the entire Earth at once; however, even this can be partially addressed with multi-view focus plus context rendering techniques~\cite{mark-sherlock}.
Because of this, there has been a recent push towards globe based Digital Earth systems, where data is assigned and visualized on a 3D model of the Earth, typically approximated as either a sphere or ellipsoid. 


To efficiently integrate data on such a 3D model, data can be assigned to an underlying discretization of the Earth into a set of non-overlapping cells (Discrete global grid). A hierarchy of such grids at successively finer resolutions allow different resolutions of data, and gives a built in representation for positional uncertainty (DGGS). 

DGGS have shown to be an effective tool for managing geospatial data on the surface of the Earth---many state of the art systems. Despite this, many modern sensors are generating 3D data (associated altitude) which traditional DGGS have no built in mechanism for. Instead, such data must be flattened with altitude stored only as an attribute. This slows down accessing data. This has motivated push towards volumetric, or 3D discrete global grids and grid systems to allow native support for such data.

Most 3D human activity and interest, and correspondingly geostatial data is in small region above and below surface of Earth (+= 10-500 km), and because of this most existing approaches to 3D grids have focused on this region. However, there a select processed such as seismic wave propagation and the magnetosphere the go much beyond (- ?? km and + 35000? km). Also high Earth orbit satellites. Because of this, need for grids that cover much larger range---high into atmosphere and all the way towards centre. 


\section{Problem Statement}

Despite recent push for 3D grids, still underdeveloped compared to traditional DGGS and GIS. Of these, most focus on small vertical range of data/grid support. The main goal of this thesis is to further develop the technologies that exist for 3D global grid systems that can properly support a large vertical range of data.

Simple approach for such a grid would be to embed Earth in 3D Euclidean grid, which many efficient and well tested techniques exist for creating. Such a grid does not respect spherical nature of Earth however. Cells not aligned with surface, low resolutions are very poor approximation, traversal along surface not straightforward. This type of grid should only be used for local small scale grids where curvature is minimal/negligible. For global grid, needs to be sphere based---Earth centric. 

The main challenge with such grids is the degeneration of cells towards the centre of the Earth due to the nature of spherical coordinates (figure)---cells become small, skinny, degenerate to triangular shaped/pyramids. This is not an issue for grids with small radial extent. This same effect happens with latitude longitude grids for similar reasons. Several works have used a special refinement strategy to address this issue, both for lat-long grids and 3D grids. (Further explained in Ch 2). Create grids we refer to as 'semiregular degenerate'. Such refinement strategies are the main tool used in this thesis for accomplishing the goal. For brevity, this class of refinement is simply referred to as semiregular refinement.  

Other desired properties of resulting grids we are concerned with are volume preservation, interoperability between 2D and 3D grids, and efficient encoding and decoding (integration) of data. 

\section{Methodology}

First approach is by modifying existing 3D DGGS known as SDOG to improve volume preservation.

This grid is good, but no interoperability between it and conventional DGGS.

Second approach is a general framework for extending DGGS to 3D. Good properties of such here.

With prismatoid grid, need to map between it and spherical 'real' space. Similar to projection for DGGS---needed for encoding and decoding. Use same principles to create mapping between conventional SDOG and modified one.

Develop more efficient encoding and decoding for these types of grids. Works for SDOG---and with the mapping---modified SDOG. Works for simple prismatoid, but not all. Discuss some methods for more complex prismatoid. Benchmark efficient vs simple for SDOG and modified SDOG.
